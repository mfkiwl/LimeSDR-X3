Changes:

LimeSDR-X3_1v2(_DB)_DFMr0:
 - Initial database (created from LimeSDR-X3_1v1(_DB)_DFMr1)
 - Schematic changes:
   > Added shields MECH30, MECH32, MECH31, MECH33, MECH35, MECH36, MECH37, MECH38, MECH39, MECH40, MECH41, MECH42 to LMS1, LMS2 and RF switches/LNAs/PAs
   > J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10, J11, J12, J13 RF UFL connectors changed to MCX connectors
   > PMOD connectors changed to BHR-12-HUA (with lock)
   > HW_VER changed to 2
   > Updated schematic template
   > Created project variables PROJECT_VERSION and SHEET_TOTAL
  - PCB changes:
   > RF part rerouted to fit under shields;
   > Some RF traces on bottom layer routed on L10. Additional requirement for embedded asymetric 50R stripline added
   > PMOD and MCX connector placement updated
   > Project version now comes from variable SHEET_TOTAL on silkscreen and in mechanical 1
   > OCXO thermal case mounting holes increased to 1.5 mm
   > PCIe bracked holes small misalignment fixed
  - New DFM files generated
